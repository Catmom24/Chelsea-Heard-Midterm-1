Here's my "More Than A Color" Fun interactive site! 
This project is an extension of my illustrative, "More than a Color Series!" This series was birthed through the various Afican American figures that positively influenced myself growing up. From Maya Angelou, to James Baldwin, each person is depicted with various colors and words of each persons accomplishments, whether that be through song, poetry, sports etc. I chose to create pigment with colors other than what's typically considered melanin and purposefully made the focus each persons accomplishments. 
This website is meant to be interactive and fun! Explore and Listen to Maya Angelou, Read A Malcom X quote, Shuffle through each illustration, Browse through the Gallery, and then finally create your own art at the very end! :) My hopes are that those who experience this have the ability to learn a little bit more about Black History in a way that's fun and informative! :)
